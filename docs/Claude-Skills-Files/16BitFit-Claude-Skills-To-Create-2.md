Based on my thorough analysis of the Anthropic Agent Skills documentation and deep examination of the 16BitFit V3 project, I've identified **12 high-impact specialized agent skills** that would dramatically improve your development workflow.  
**Top Priority Skills for 16BitFit V3**

🎯 **Critical Path (P0) \- Implement First**

1. **react-native-pixel-component-builder** \- Generates pixel-perfect components with your Game Boy LCD 4-color palette, enforcing accessibility and atomic design principles. Would reduce component creation from 2-3 hours to 15-20 minutes.  
2. **ios-xcode-troubleshooter** \- Diagnoses and fixes iOS build failures, CocoaPods issues, and Xcode configuration problems. Your recent build audit identified 13 critical issues that this skill would auto-resolve.  
3. **design-token-enforcer** \- Validates and enforces design token usage, preventing hardcoded colors and ensuring consistent Game Boy aesthetic across all components.

💪 **High Value (P1)**

1. **healthkit-google-fit-integration** \- Specialized for implementing health data integrations with COPPA/GDPR compliance, encryption, and privacy-first patterns.  
2. **supabase-rls-policy-generator** \- Generates Row Level Security policies for Supabase tables, ensuring proper data isolation and audit trails.  
3. **testing-react-native-components** \- Generates comprehensive test suites with coverage for animations, gestures, and platform-specific behavior.

🚀 **Force Multipliers (P2)**

1. **webview-bridge-architect** \- Implements the Hybrid Velocity Bridge between React Native and Phaser 3 with \<50ms latency.  
2. **android-gradle-optimizer** \- Optimizes Android builds, resolves Health Connect compatibility, and fixes deep-link inconsistencies.  
3. **supabase-edge-function-builder** \- Generates Deno-based Edge Functions for avatar generation (DALL-E 3\) and other serverless logic.

🎨 **Creative Tools (P3)**

1. **pixel-art-asset-generator** \- Creates/validates pixel art sprites and icons conforming to Game Boy aesthetic using AI generation.  
2. **story-acceptance-criteria-validator** \- Generates test plans and validates acceptance criteria for your 14 user stories.  
3. **security-audit-automator** \- Scans for hardcoded secrets, validates .gitignore coverage, and ensures COPPA/GDPR compliance.

**Why These Skills Matter**

Your project has unique challenges:

* **Strict Design System**: 4-color LCD palette that must be enforced everywhere  
* **Complex Architecture**: React Native \+ Phaser 3 WebView hybrid  
* **Health Data Privacy**: COPPA/GDPR compliance requirements  
* **Multi-Platform**: iOS/Android with native module integrations  
* **Performance Critical**: 60 FPS animations, \<50ms bridge latency

Each skill encapsulates deep domain expertise and includes:

* Pre-built templates and patterns  
* Validation and error prevention  
* Automated test generation  
* Progressive disclosure of relevant documentation

**Expected Impact**

Implementing these skills would:

* **Reduce component creation by 70%**  
* **Eliminate recurring build failures**  
* **Ensure 100% design system compliance**  
* **Accelerate health integration from weeks to days**  
* **Prevent security vulnerabilities before shipping**

These aren't just automation tools \- they're domain experts that understand your specific tech stack, design requirements, and business logic. They would transform Claude Code from a general assistant into a specialized 16BitFit development expert.

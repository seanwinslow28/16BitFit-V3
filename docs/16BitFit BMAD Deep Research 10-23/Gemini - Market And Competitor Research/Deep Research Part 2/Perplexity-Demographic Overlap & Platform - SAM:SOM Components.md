# **Objective:** Provide specific data and synthesis on the overlap between mobile gamers and fitness tracker users (ages 18-55) in North America (USA/Canada) for 2025 or latest data, including platform prevalence (iOS/Android) and health data sync adoption (HealthKit/Google Fit/Health Connect). Cite all sources. **Specific Questions:** 1. What is the best estimate for the percentage **and** absolute number of North American adults (ages 18-55) who **both** regularly play mobile games (especially action/fighting genres, if data exists) **AND** regularly use fitness tracking apps or wearables that sync with Apple HealthKit or Google Fit/Health Connect? What are the key demographics (age range, gender, income, education) of this overlapping group? *(Target: Refine 10-15%, 19-28M estimate)* 2. Confirm the latest (Q3/Q4 2025) market share percentages for iOS vs. Android mobile operating systems specifically within the **USA** and **Canada**. What is the overall smartphone penetration rate in these countries? 3. What is the current status of Google Fit API deprecation (confirming 2025 shutdown)? What is its replacement, Health Connect, and what percentage of the active Android install base (esp. Android 14+) likely has access to it? 4. What percentage of North American fitness app users actively **sync** their data with either Apple HealthKit or Google Fit/Health Connect? How crucial is this integration considered by users based on app reviews or surveys? *(Target: Refine 60-70% estimate)* 5. Provide the most specific available demographic breakdown (age, gender primarily) for players of **mobile fighting games** in North America. How does this compare to the broader mobile gaming audience? *(Target: Refine age/gender estimates)*

Now I have comprehensive data to synthesize the response. Let me create a detailed report answering all five questions with specific citations.

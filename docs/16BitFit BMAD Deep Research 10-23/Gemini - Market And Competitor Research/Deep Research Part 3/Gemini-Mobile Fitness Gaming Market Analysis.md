# **The Exer-Combat Opportunity: A Market Analysis of Skill-Based Fitness Gaming on Mobile**

## **Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive competitive intelligence analysis of the mobile application market at the intersection of skill-based fighting games and real-world fitness data integration. The analysis indicates a significant and currently unoccupied market niche for a high-quality "exer-combat" mobile game. While the market contains adjacent applications—fitness-themed fighting simulators that lack data integration and fitness-integrated RPGs that lack skill-based combat—no direct competitor has successfully synthesized these two popular genres.

The potential scale of this opportunity is substantial. An examination of adjacent markets reveals strong user engagement and monetization in both the mobile fighting game and digital fitness sectors. Top-tier mobile fighting games like *Mortal Kombat Mobile* demonstrate a high revenue ceiling, generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in worldwide revenue monthly. Concurrently, the digital fitness market is massive, with leaders like Strava boasting 50 million monthly active users and generating over $160 million in annual revenue. Specialized, subscription-based fitness apps like Fitbod further prove a strong user willingness to pay for premium, personalized experiences, achieving $1 million in monthly revenue from a focused user base.

Crucially, strategic movements from major global publishers validate the underlying premise of high-intensity fitness gaming. Tencent, a leader in the global gaming market, recently led a $10 million Series A funding round for Quell, a UK-based developer creating a high-intensity combat fitness game paired with a proprietary wearable device. This investment serves as a powerful third-party validation of the exer-combat concept, signaling a belief in its market viability at the highest level of the industry.

In contrast, other major publishers, including those with significant fighting game intellectual property like Capcom, have not yet announced public initiatives in this space. This, combined with a broader market trend of consolidation, as seen with Electronic Arts' recent culling of its mobile portfolio to focus on "concentrated bets," defines a clear but potentially fleeting window of opportunity.

The primary strategic recommendation is that a significant market opportunity exists for a first-mover to launch an accessible, mobile-native, skill-based exer-combat game. Success is contingent upon delivering a high-quality experience in both the fighting game mechanics and the fitness data integration, adopting a hybrid monetization model that appeals to both gamer and fitness enthusiast psychographics, and prioritizing community-building features to drive long-term retention.

## **The "Exer-Combat" Niche: A Competitive Landscape Analysis**

To accurately assess the competitive environment, this analysis establishes a strict framework for defining a direct competitor. A true "exer-combat" application must satisfy two core criteria: first, it must feature skill-based combat mechanics, where player input, timing, and strategy are paramount, as opposed to turn-based, idle, or automated systems. Second, it must integrate real-world, user-generated fitness data (e.g., steps, heart rate, workout logs) in a way that meaningfully influences gameplay, character progression, or in-game resources. An exhaustive review of the current mobile market reveals that no application launched or announced for the 2024-2025 period fully satisfies both criteria. The landscape is instead populated by two distinct categories of adjacent competitors: fitness-integrated RPGs and fitness-themed fighting games.

### **Analysis of Fitness-Integrated RPGs: The Closest Proxies**

Applications in this category successfully integrate fitness data but apply it to simpler, non-skill-based game genres, primarily Role-Playing Games (RPGs). These apps serve as the closest existing proxies and provide valuable precedents for technical integration, user motivation, and potential monetization strategies.

#### **Case Study: Run Legends**

Launched in January 2024, *Run Legends* represents a significant and recent market entrant in the gamified fitness space.1 The application's core mechanic involves using real-world movement, tracked via the phone's GPS, to control a character in turn-based RPG battles. The pace of the user's walk or run directly impacts their actions in the game. This model successfully gamifies cardiovascular exercise, offering daily in-game rewards to incentivize consistent activity. Notably, *Run Legends* positions itself with a focus on mental as well as physical health; players battle "Sappers," which are described as enemies representing real-life anxieties. This thematic choice, combined with a feature that allows users to set their own comfortable pace, demonstrates an understanding of the broader wellness-focused audience that may be attracted to such a hybrid application.1

#### **Case Study: LevelUP: Fitness**

*LevelUP: Fitness* is another prominent example that explicitly markets itself as a "Fitness RPG Adventure".2 Its model is straightforward: users log real-world workouts to earn experience points (XP), which in turn level up their in-game character's stats. Completing daily fitness challenges and quests unlocks access to "Epic Dungeons" where they can battle monsters. The application features extensive RPG elements, including over 180 unique items of gear and equipment, unlockable titles, and competitive leaderboards.2

User feedback for *LevelUP: Fitness* is particularly illuminating. Reviews from early 2025 indicate that the core concept is highly motivating for users who are interested in gaming but struggle with workout consistency.2 However, this feedback also reveals a desire for deeper, more traditional gameplay loops and more robust social features. One user review explicitly stated the app would be "even better if the battle system wasn't based around workouts," suggesting a preference for a model where workouts fuel character progression (XP gain) but the battles themselves are a more conventional, engaging RPG system. The same review called for more social mechanics like guilds and group dungeons.2 This suggests that while fitness integration is a powerful motivator for user acquisition, long-term retention may depend on the quality and depth of the core game loop itself. A skill-based fighting game, with its inherently higher mechanical depth, could directly address this user-identified gap.

#### **Case Study: Fitness RPG**

*Fitness RPG* offers a well-established model for low-friction fitness integration.3 The app's primary mechanic is to convert steps, tracked either by the phone's native pedometer or by syncing with a Fitbit device, into "free energy." This energy is then used to power a team of heroes in a classic RPG setting, allowing them to level up, explore a world map, and battle monsters. The app's deep integration with Apple's HealthKit platform demonstrates a proven technical pathway for accessing user fitness data reliably.4 Furthermore, *Fitness RPG* provides a clear monetization precedent with its "SuperPass" subscription, which offers access to exclusive resources and premium features for a monthly fee.4 This validates the subscription model as a viable strategy for this type of hybrid application.

### **Analysis of Fitness-Themed Fighting Games: Thematic Overlap without Integration**

The second category of adjacent competitors includes games that adopt the aesthetics and themes of fitness and combat sports but are mechanically conventional mobile fighting games. These titles are crucial to analyze as they establish a baseline for player expectations regarding the "fighting" component of an exer-combat game, but their defining characteristic is the complete absence of real-world fitness data integration.

#### **Case Study: Gym Fight: Fighting Revolution & Gym Heros: Fighting Game**

These two titles are emblematic of the genre.5 Both games are set in gym environments and feature bodybuilder-style characters engaging in 1v1 combat that combines styles like boxing, karate, and wrestling. The gameplay is standard for the mobile fighting genre, focused on executing combos and special moves through screen inputs. The progression systems are also typical, involving unlocking new fighters and upgrading skills through in-game currency. Monetization relies on common free-to-play mechanics, such as in-app purchases to unlock all players, remove advertisements, or buy in-game currency.5 While these games use "Gym" and "Fight" in their titles, the fitness element is purely thematic. The user's physical condition or real-world workouts have no bearing on the gameplay, highlighting the key innovation and differentiator of the proposed exer-combat concept.

### **Conclusion: The Unoccupied Niche**

The preceding analysis of the competitive landscape leads to a clear and definitive conclusion: as of the 2024-2025 period, no mobile application from a major publisher explicitly and effectively combines high-fidelity, skill-based fighting game mechanics with meaningful, real-world fitness data integration. The market is bifurcated. On one side are fitness RPGs that have successfully validated the concept of converting physical activity into in-game progression, but they do so with relatively simple, non-skill-based core gameplay loops. On the other side are fitness-themed fighting simulators that offer a combat experience but are entirely disconnected from the user's actual physical fitness.

This bifurcation creates a distinct and unoccupied market niche. The existing market has proven the viability of the component parts in isolation: players are willing to engage deeply with mobile fighting games, and a separate audience is highly motivated by applications that gamify their fitness journey. The untapped opportunity lies in the synthesis of these two validated concepts, creating a product that could potentially capture and retain a new hybrid audience that is currently underserved by both categories.

## **Sizing the Opportunity: An Analysis of Adjacent Markets**

To quantify the potential addressable market for a novel exer-combat application, it is essential to analyze the performance of established applications in its constituent and adjacent sectors. By examining the user acquisition, engagement, and revenue metrics of leading mobile fighting games, gamified fitness apps, and mainstream digital fitness platforms, it is possible to establish data-driven benchmarks for success. The following analysis focuses on recent (2024-2025) North American market data to provide a relevant and timely estimate of the opportunity's scale.

### **The Mobile Fighting Game Market: High Engagement, IAP-Driven**

The mobile fighting game genre is characterized by dedicated fan bases, high engagement, and monetization models heavily reliant on in-app purchases (IAP), often through gacha-style mechanics for character collection and upgrades.

* **Street Fighter Duel:** Published by Crunchyroll Games, this title leverages a legendary intellectual property (IP).7 It has achieved a significant install base, with over 1 million downloads on the Google Play store alone.10 However, recent data from 2025 suggests the app is in a mature phase of its lifecycle. Sensor Tower reports worldwide monthly downloads have fallen below 5,000, with worldwide monthly revenue fluctuating between $30,000 and $50,000.7 The game's mechanics are more akin to an idle RPG than a traditional skill-based fighter, focusing on team building and coordinating combos rather than direct execution.9 This performance provides a baseline for a well-known IP using a less skill-intensive, collection-focused model.  
* **Mortal Kombat Mobile:** In contrast, *Mortal Kombat Mobile* from Warner Bros. represents the upper echelon of the market. The title boasts a massive global footprint, with an install range of 100 million to 500 million on Google Play.11 Recent performance remains robust; Sensor Tower data from 2025 indicates worldwide monthly downloads between 300,000 and 600,000, generating worldwide monthly revenue between $300,000 and $400,000.11 Earlier in 2024, one report noted the title had already accumulated $8.2 million in gross player spending for the year.13 This demonstrates the substantial and sustained revenue potential for a top-tier, high-fidelity mobile fighting game with a strong brand in the North American market.

### **The Gamified Fitness Market: Narrative-Driven, Subscription-Based**

This category is defined by its use of game-like mechanics and storytelling to motivate physical activity. The primary business model shifts from IAP to recurring subscriptions.

* **Zombies, Run\!:** As the preeminent example of narrative-driven fitness, *Zombies, Run\!* has cultivated a large and loyal following over many years. The application claims a user base of over 10 million players, making it one of the largest smartphone fitness games ever.14 Its business model is centered on a subscription that unlocks its full library of over 500 audio missions, priced at $6.99 per month or $49.99 per year.16 While specific North American revenue figures are not available in the provided materials, Sensor Tower data for the broader "zombie game" category on mobile platforms shows significant market appetite. Top titles within this theme consistently generate millions of dollars in monthly revenue and attract hundreds of thousands of weekly active users in the US.17 The longevity of *Zombies, Run\!* and its recent expansion into the ZRX app, which now includes a collaboration with Marvel for "Marvel Move," underscores the viability of using strong narrative and major IP to drive a successful subscription-based fitness product.16

### **The Digital Fitness & Tracking Market: Massive Scale, Diverse Monetization**

This broad category encompasses everything from social networks for athletes to AI-powered personal trainers. The user bases are enormous, and monetization strategies are varied, providing a look at the total potential market for digital health and fitness solutions.

* **Strava:** As the leading social network for endurance athletes, Strava demonstrates the immense scale achievable by a fitness app that successfully fosters community. In 2025, the platform reported an average of 50 million monthly active users.20 This massive engagement translates into significant revenue, with the company generating $163.4 million in 2024\.21 Strava's success highlights the critical importance of social and competitive features in driving long-term user retention and willingness to pay for premium features.  
* **Nike Run Club (NRC) & Nike Training Club (NTC):** Nike's digital ecosystem operates on a different strategic model, functioning as a brand engagement tool rather than a direct revenue driver. Both NRC and NTC are completely free to use.22 Despite the lack of direct monetization, their reach is vast. Recent Sensor Tower data shows NRC achieving 500,000 worldwide monthly downloads, while NTC garners 100,000.23 NTC alone is reported to have 1.8 million active users.25 These figures demonstrate the potential for massive user acquisition when the barrier to entry is removed, serving as a powerful top-of-funnel for Nike's broader apparel and equipment business.  
* **Fitbod:** This AI-powered workout planner serves as a key benchmark for a premium, subscription-based fitness utility. Fitbod has found a highly monetizable niche by offering personalized, data-driven strength training programs. Recent Sensor Tower data is impressive, showing 200,000 worldwide monthly downloads that generate $1 million in worldwide monthly revenue.26 This high revenue-per-download ratio is a strong indicator that a dedicated segment of the fitness market is willing to pay a premium for a sophisticated, effective, and personalized digital training tool.

### **Comparative Market Performance**

The following table consolidates the available 2024-2025 performance metrics for these adjacent applications, providing an at-a-glance comparison of their market scale and monetization efficiency.

| App Name | Category | Primary Monetization Model | Monthly Downloads (Worldwide) | Monthly Revenue (Worldwide) | Active Users | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Street Fighter Duel** | Fighting Game / Idle RPG | IAP / Gacha | \< 5,000 | $30,000 \- $50,000 | Not Available | 7 |
| **Mortal Kombat Mobile** | Fighting Game | IAP | 300,000 \- 600,000 | $300,000 \- $400,000 | Not Available | 11 |
| **Zombies, Run\!** | Gamified Fitness | Subscription | Not Available | Not Available | 10M+ (Lifetime Players) | 14 |
| **Strava** | Fitness Social Network | Subscription | Not Available | \~$13.6M (2024 Avg) | 50M (Monthly) | 20 |
| **Nike Run Club** | Fitness Tracker | Free (Brand Ecosystem) | 500,000 | \< $5,000 | Not Available | 23 |
| **Nike Training Club** | Workout App | Free (Brand Ecosystem) | 100,000 | \< $5,000 | 1.8M (Monthly) | 24 |
| **Fitbod** | AI Workout Planner | Subscription | 200,000 | $1,000,000 | Not Available | 26 |

This comparative data illustrates a clear picture of the market landscape. The mobile fighting game sector offers a high revenue ceiling for top performers, driven by IAP. The fitness sector, while having a massive free user base via brands like Nike, also supports highly lucrative subscription businesses like Strava and Fitbod, which command significant monthly recurring revenue from millions of engaged users. An exer-combat application has the unique potential to tap into both of these lucrative pools.

## **The Strategic Environment: Market Dynamics and Publisher Intent**

Beyond the direct competitive landscape, the viability of a new exer-combat application is influenced by broader market trends, the strategic posture of major game publishers, and signals of investment in the fitness gaming sector. The current environment is characterized by market maturation, strategic consolidation by established players, and a landmark investment by a global gaming leader that strongly validates the exer-combat concept.

### **Market Entry & Gamified Fitness Momentum**

The gamified fitness category continues to demonstrate momentum and attract new innovation. The launch of *Run Legends* in January 2024 is a prime example of a recent, significant market entry, indicating that developers still see opportunities for growth and differentiation within the space.1 This launch aligns with a broader industry trend where gamification is increasingly recognized as a key driver of user engagement and motivation in fitness. Industry analyses for 2025 explicitly identify gamification as one of the most significant developments, transforming workouts into interactive and rewarding experiences.27 This is occurring within a fitness app market that is projected to experience explosive growth, with some forecasts predicting the market could exceed $56 billion by 2030\.28 This confirms a powerful and sustained tailwind for any new application built on the principles of gamification.

### **Market Exits & Publisher Consolidation: The EA Case Study**

While new entrants are emerging, the broader mobile gaming market is showing signs of maturation, leading established publishers to refine their strategies. Electronic Arts (EA) provides a compelling case study in this trend. In early 2025, EA announced the shutdown of eight mobile titles, seven of which came from its 2021 $2.1 billion acquisition of Glu Mobile.29 This move should not be interpreted as a retreat from the mobile market, but rather as a strategic consolidation.

This action aligns with EA's publicly stated intent to make fewer, more "concentrated bets" on mobile platforms.30 The era of maintaining a large, diverse portfolio of moderate performers appears to be ending. Success in the current market requires high-quality, deeply engaging titles with robust long-term monetization potential. Publishers are now more willing to cull underperforming assets to focus resources on potential blockbusters. The implication for a new market entrant is clear: the quality bar for achieving sustainable success is rising. A new application cannot be a simple gimmick; it must offer a polished, best-in-class experience in both its core gameplay and its unique features to compete for user attention and spending. It is also noteworthy that searches for a dedicated fitness gaming initiative from EA yield no results, pointing only to a branded app for a third-party gym and fitness-themed content for its existing *The Sims* franchise, reinforcing its focus on core gaming IPs.31

### **Major Publisher Investment Signals: The Tencent-Quell Precedent**

Perhaps the most significant development in the strategic environment is the clear signal of interest in the exer-combat niche from a global gaming titan. Tencent, one of the world's largest game publishers, recently acted as the lead investor in a $10 million Series A funding round for Quell, a UK-based fitness gaming developer.34 This investment is a watershed moment for the category and provides powerful third-party validation for the core concept of high-intensity, combat-based fitness gaming.

Quell's product, the 'Impact' fitness gaming system, is a hardware-centric platform featuring a proprietary wearable device with athlete-grade resistance bands and haptic feedback. It is designed to be used with its launch title, *Shardfall*, an intense combat game where workouts are designed to burn over 600 kcal per hour—comparable to an intense spin class.34 Tencent's decision to lead a substantial funding round for a company with this specific focus demonstrates a strong belief in the existence of a viable market for products that fuse demanding physical exercise with compelling combat gameplay. Dr. Ling Ge, Tencent's Chief European Representative and a Quell board member, explicitly stated that Quell solves the problem of previous fitness games failing to provide both a great gaming and a great fitness experience simultaneously.34 This investment is not a speculative bet on a fringe idea; it is a calculated move by a sophisticated market leader. This interest is not new; Tencent previously developed *Timi Run Everyday*, a gamified fitness app in China that integrated with a fitness tracker to provide in-game rewards, showing a long-standing strategic interest in this space.35

This development creates a fascinating strategic dichotomy. Quell is pursuing a high-friction, hardware-dependent model. This approach, while potentially offering a deeply integrated experience and a strong competitive moat, requires consumers to make a dedicated, and likely costly, hardware purchase. This inherently limits its initial addressable market. A mobile-first, software-only exer-combat application, which can leverage the billions of existing smartphones and a growing ecosystem of wearables (like Apple Watch and Fitbit), represents the inverse strategy. It offers a low-friction, highly accessible entry point for consumers. Tencent's validation of the market's demand, combined with Quell's high-friction approach, creates a clear strategic opening for an accessible software-based solution to capture a potentially much larger user base.

### **Other Publisher Activity (or Lack Thereof)**

An extensive review of the market confirms a notable absence of similar public initiatives from other major publishers, particularly those who are stewards of major fighting game franchises. There is no evidence of Capcom, the creator of *Street Fighter*, developing or announcing a fitness-integrated mobile title.2 This lack of activity from direct IP holders is significant. It defines the current window of opportunity, allowing a new entrant to potentially establish a strong market position and brand identity before the owners of legacy fighting game IPs decide to enter the space.

## **Synthesis and Strategic Recommendations**

The comprehensive analysis of the competitive landscape, adjacent markets, and the strategic environment reveals a clear and compelling business opportunity. A distinct market gap exists for a mobile application that successfully merges the deep, engaging mechanics of a skill-based fighting game with the motivational power of real-world fitness data integration. The potential market is substantial, drawing from the large and highly monetizable user bases of both the mobile gaming and digital fitness sectors. Furthermore, the strategic actions of major industry players provide both a warning and a powerful validation: while the bar for quality is rising, the core concept of high-intensity fitness gaming has received a significant vote of confidence. To capitalize on this opportunity, the following strategic recommendations should be considered.

### **Defining the Core Opportunity**

The core opportunity is to develop and launch the first accessible, mobile-native, skill-based "exer-combat" game. The product should be positioned as a "game that gets you fit," appealing to gamers seeking motivation for physical activity, and a "workout that's actually fun," targeting fitness enthusiasts who are bored with conventional exercise apps. By being software-only and leveraging existing mobile and wearable hardware, the application can serve as the low-friction, mass-market entry point into a niche that is currently being validated by high-friction, hardware-based competitors.

### **Key Success Factors & Strategic Choices**

To succeed, a new entrant must excel in several key areas and make deliberate strategic choices regarding its product and business model.

* **Core Loop Quality:** The application's success is fundamentally dependent on the quality of its two core loops. The fighting game must feature responsive controls, deep mechanics, and a satisfying progression system that can stand on its own. Simultaneously, the fitness integration must be seamless, reliable, and rewarding. A failure to deliver a best-in-class experience on either front will cripple the entire product.  
* **Fitness Data Integration Strategy:** A tiered approach to data integration is recommended. For maximum accessibility and user acquisition, the application should support low-friction data sources like the phone's built-in pedometer as a baseline. This allows anyone to download and play immediately. To drive deeper engagement and cater to more serious fitness users, the app must offer enhanced integration with popular wearables (e.g., Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin). Connecting these devices could unlock more granular gameplay effects (e.g., a "rage meter" that fills based on heart rate) and provide more significant in-game rewards, incentivizing deeper investment in the ecosystem.  
* **Monetization Model:** The product's unique hybrid nature calls for a hybrid monetization model. A pure IAP/gacha model, common in fighting games, may alienate the fitness audience, while a pure subscription model, common in fitness apps, may limit the acquisition of traditional gamers. A recommended approach is a "freemium-plus-subscription" model. The core game should be free-to-play, supported by cosmetic IAPs (e.g., character skins, victory poses) that appeal to the gamer desire for personalization. A recurring monthly subscription should then be offered that unlocks premium features targeted at the fitness user, such as advanced workout plans, detailed performance analytics, and deeper data integration.  
* **Community and Social Features:** The long-term retention of users in both gaming and fitness is heavily driven by community. Learning from the success of Strava and the user feedback for existing fitness RPGs, social features must be a priority from day one.2 This includes competitive leaderboards (global, regional, and among friends), the ability to form guilds or teams to complete collaborative challenges, and direct player-vs-player (PvP) modes. These features transform a solitary activity into a shared social experience, which is a powerful driver of sustained engagement.

### **Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies**

While the opportunity is significant, it is accompanied by unique risks that require proactive mitigation strategies.

* **Risk: Audience Mismatch:** There is a potential risk that the core audience of hardcore fighting game players does not significantly overlap with the audience of dedicated fitness enthusiasts, leading to a smaller-than-expected addressable market.  
  * **Mitigation:** The primary target should not be the extremes of either group, but the large, underserved middle. Marketing and product positioning should focus on casual gamers who want to be more active and fitness users who are seeking more engaging and entertaining ways to exercise. The value proposition is the fusion of fun and fitness, not just competitive depth or calorie counting.  
* **Risk: Execution Complexity:** Developing a high-quality fighting game is technically demanding. Developing a robust fitness tracking application is also complex. Attempting to do both simultaneously in a single product presents a significant execution risk.  
  * **Mitigation:** A phased development and rollout strategy is essential. The initial launch (Minimum Viable Product) should prioritize a polished, satisfying core fighting loop and a simple, but highly reliable, fitness integration (e.g., step-to-energy conversion). This ensures the foundational experience is excellent. More complex features, such as additional data integrations, advanced training plans, and new game modes, can be layered in over time through subsequent updates.  
* **Risk: Incumbent Entry:** The current window of opportunity exists because major publishers with established fighting game IPs have not yet entered the exer-combat space. An announcement from a company like Capcom or Bandai Namco could dramatically alter the competitive landscape.  
  * **Mitigation:** Speed to market is the primary mitigation for this risk. By launching first and rapidly building a dedicated user base and a strong brand identity, a new entrant can establish a significant first-mover advantage. Creating a strong community around the product can build a defensive moat that makes it more difficult for a late-arriving incumbent to capture market share, even with a recognizable IP. The time to act on this opportunity is now.

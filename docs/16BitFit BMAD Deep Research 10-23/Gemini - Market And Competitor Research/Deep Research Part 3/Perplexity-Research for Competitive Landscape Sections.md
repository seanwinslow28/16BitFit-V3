# 1. **Confirm Priority 1 Threats:** Based on current market data (NA revenue, user base, FGC engagement), are Street Fighter Duel and Mortal Kombat Mobile still the most relevant high-market-share competitors in the mobile fighting game space for a FGC-adjacent audience in 2025? Are there others that should be considered Priority 1? 2. **Identify Priority 2 Threats:** Beyond Zombies, Run!, what other notable mobile apps (even low market share) are currently innovating in the space between fitness tracking and active gameplay (not just passive gamification)? Look for apps using unique mechanics, AR, or strong narratives tied to exercise.

I have gathered substantial information about both mobile fighting games and fitness apps that combine active gameplay with narrative elements. Let me compile the comprehensive analysis now.

## **Priority 1 Threats: Mobile Fighting Games for FGC Audiences in 2025**

### **Street Fighter Duel and Mortal Kombat Mobile: Current Status**

**Street Fighter Duel** is **no longer a priority threat** for a FGC-adjacent audience in 2025. The game has experienced catastrophic decline:[^1][^2][^3]

- Revenue collapsed from \$10M in its first month (March 2023) to approximately \$2M by month three, representing an 80% drop-off[^2][^3]
- Current monthly revenue is estimated at under \$50K with fewer than 5K downloads in the US market[^4][^5]
- The game has suffered continuous player base erosion and failed to capitalize on major collaborations like the Monster Hunter crossover[^3]
- Street Fighter Duel functions as an idle RPG gacha game, not a traditional fighter, limiting its appeal to core FGC players

**Mortal Kombat Mobile** maintains **modest relevance** but shows mixed signals:[^6][^7][^8]

- The game has accumulated over 138M downloads historically across the franchise[^7]
- Daily active users are estimated around 4,949 players currently, with approximately 143K monthly active users[^6]
- The console/PC title Mortal Kombat 11 (not mobile) averages 1,602 daily players on Steam as of recent data[^6]
- MK Mobile ranks \#82 in the Action category on Google Play in the US, indicating moderate but not dominant positioning[^8]


### **Actual Priority 1 Threats for FGC Audiences**

Based on 2025 data, the following should be considered **Priority 1 threats**:

**1. Brawlhalla (Mobile)**[^9][^10][^11][^12]

- **100M+ total players** across all platforms with active cross-play functionality
- Over **10M downloads** on mobile (Android alone)[^10]
- Platform fighter with legitimate competitive depth and FGC crossover appeal
- Features 50+ legends including crossover characters like Ryu (Street Fighter), John Cena, and Master Chief[^11][^10]
- **Active esports scene** with the Brawlhalla Championship Expo (BCX) continuing in 2025[^12][^13]
- Free-to-play with regular content updates and seasonal events throughout 2025[^14][^12]
- Strong community engagement and ranked competitive modes

**2. Shadow Fight 4: Arena**[^15][^16][^17]

- Substantial mobile fighting game with **PvP focus** appealing to competitive players
- Features real-time 3v3 team battles with strategic depth
- Over **60 unique heroes** with customizable abilities and talent systems[^15]
- Active competitive scene with tournaments and ranked progression
- Regular content updates with new fight passes monthly[^15]
- Strong engagement metrics with 1.68M reviews averaging 4.7 stars on Google Play[^15]

**3. Injustice 2 (Mobile)**[^18][^19]

- Consistently ranks in top 10 mobile fighting games lists for 2025[^19][^18]
- NetherRealm's fighting game pedigree with deep combat mechanics
- Strong DC Comics IP appeal with narrative-driven campaign
- Active player base with regular content updates


### **Why These Matter More Than Street Fighter Duel/MK Mobile**

- **Competitive legitimacy**: Brawlhalla and Shadow Fight 4 Arena offer genuine competitive gameplay that attracts FGC-adjacent audiences
- **Active player bases**: All three maintain substantially larger and more engaged communities than Street Fighter Duel
- **Regular updates**: Consistent content releases throughout 2025 indicate long-term viability[^13][^12]
- **Cross-platform appeal**: Brawlhalla's cross-play ecosystem creates a genuine competitive environment

## **Priority 2 Threats: Fitness + Active Gameplay Innovation Beyond Zombies, Run!**

### **Narrative-Driven Fitness Apps**

**1. Marvel Move (within ZRX App)**[^20][^21][^22][^23]

### **Move-to-Earn (Blockchain Gaming)**

**8. STEPN**[^51][^52][^53][^54]

- **Web3 move-to-earn app** on Solana blockchain rewarding cryptocurrency for walking/running
- Users purchase **NFT sneakers** (ranging from Walker to Trainer types) to earn Green Satoshi Tokens (GST)[^53][^51]
- Sneaker attributes and quality determine earning potential and efficiency[^53]
- Governance token (GMT) allows platform voting and staking rewards[^51][^53]

- **Market consideration**: Move-to-earn market projected to grow from \$649.9M (2024) to \$1.7B (2030)[^56]

### **Traditional Fitness with Gamification**

### **Key Innovation Patterns Beyond Zombies, Run!**

1. **Marvel IP Integration**: Marvel Move represents the first major superhero franchise in narrative fitness[^20][^22][^21]
2. **AR Without Wearables**: Active Arcade's camera-based motion tracking eliminates hardware barriers[^33][^31][^32]
3. **VR Immersion**: Supernatural and Fitness Fables offer environmental escapism unavailable in audio-only apps[^42][^49][^44]
4. **Blockchain Incentives**: STEPN introduces financial motivation through crypto earnings[^51][^53]
5. **Physical Controllers**: Ring Fit Adventure's proprietary hardware provides form feedback impossible with phone-only apps[^58][^59]
6. **Martial Arts AR**: Kayyo specifically targets combat sports training with AI-powered technique coaching[^35]
7. **Location-Based AR Evolution**: Jurassic World Alive demonstrates ongoing viability of Pokémon GO-style gameplay with refined mechanics[^36][^38]

### **Declining/Marginal Fitness Apps**

- **Pikmin Bloom**: Persistent step-tracking technical issues throughout 2025[^66][^67][^68][^69]
- **Habitica**: Gamification of task management rather than active gameplay; doesn't require physical movement tied to game progression[^70][^71][^72]
- **Pokémon GO**: Still active but passive fitness mechanics—no narrative tied to exercise intensity or active combat gameplay[^73][^74][^75]


### **Overall Assessment**

The fitness-gaming convergence space has **significantly evolved** beyond Zombies, Run!'s audio narrative + passive tracking model:

- **Active AR** (Active Arcade, Kayyo) removes equipment barriers while requiring full-body engagement
- **Franchise narratives** (Marvel Move) leverage established IP for deeper character-driven motivation
- **VR immersion** (Supernatural, Fitness Fables) provides visual/environmental escapism unavailable in audio-only experiences
- **Hardware integration** (Ring Fit Adventure) offers form validation and gamification depth beyond software-only solutions
- **Economic incentives** (STEPN) introduce controversial but novel blockchain-based reward systems

For a product targeting FGC-adjacent audiences seeking fitness innovation, the combination of **martial arts mechanics** (Kayyo), **narrative depth** (Marvel Move), and **AR accessibility** (Active Arcade) represents the strongest competitive positioning beyond Zombies, Run!'s established running-focused niche.

  .from('user_profiles')
  .update({
    fitness_archetype: selectedArchetype,
    onboarding_completed: false, // Not complete until photo uploaded
  })
  .eq('id', userId);
```

## Testing

- Test all 5 archetype selections
- Test deferred auth flow
- Test back button navigation
- Verify data persistence
- Test with/without keyboard

## Dependencies

- Story 1.2 (Auth) must be complete
- React Navigation

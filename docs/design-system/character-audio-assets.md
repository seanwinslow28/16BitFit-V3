## Production Notes

### ElevenLabs Generation Tips

**Voice/Grunt Generation:**
- Use ElevenLabs Voice Design feature to create distinct character voices
- For grunts/efforts: Use short text prompts like "Ugh!", "Hyah!", "Yeah!"
- Adjust voice settings:
  - **Stability:** 50-70% (allows natural variation)
  - **Clarity:** 70-90% (keeps it crisp for 8-bit feel)
  - **Style Exaggeration:** 30-50% (for character personality)

**Music Generation:**
- Use ElevenLabs Music generation (or AI music tools like Suno, Udio)
- Prompts should specify:
  - Genre: "8-bit chiptune, Street Fighter 2 style"
  - Tempo: Exact BPM
  - Mood: Emotional tone
  - Instruments: "Game Boy sound chip, 4-channel audio"
  - Structure: "Loopable, seamless loop point"

**SFX Generation:**
- Use ElevenLabs SFX generation for character-specific sounds
- Describe sounds with onomatopoeia: "wooden clatter", "spring boing", "metallic crackle"
- Generate longer than needed, trim in post-production
- Layer multiple SFX for complex sounds (e.g., "cracking + sparking" for Stress Titan)

**Post-Production:**
- **Normalization:** Ensure consistent volume levels across all assets
- **Compression:** Apply light compression for consistent dynamics
- **EQ:** Cut below 100Hz for 8-bit authenticity (Game Boy had limited bass)
- **Bit-Crushing (Optional):** Apply subtle bit reduction for retro feel
- **Looping:** Use audio editing software (Audacity, Audition) to create seamless loops for BGM

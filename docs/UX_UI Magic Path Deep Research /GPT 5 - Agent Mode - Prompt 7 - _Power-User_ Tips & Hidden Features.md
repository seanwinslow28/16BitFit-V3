| **1 – Recall components with `@component_name`** | Community testers discovered that you can recall previously generated components by prefixing the name with an `@` symbol. Instead of drawing the same header again, type a prompt like “Add `@Navbar` above the hero section” and MagicPath will reference the stored component. Birdzhan Hassan’s exploration notes that this `@` syntax is not documented but it is essential for building consistent interfaces quickly[medium.com](https://medium.com/@birdzhanhasan_26235/magicpath-ai-183688ec4c9d#:~:text=Eventually%2C%20I%20learned%20that%20you,easily%20import%20my%20previous%20work). | Medium (Birdzhan Hassan)[medium.com](https://medium.com/@birdzhanhasan_26235/magicpath-ai-183688ec4c9d#:~:text=Eventually%2C%20I%20learned%20that%20you,easily%20import%20my%20previous%20work) |
| **2 – Use *Design Reference* to reuse elements** | MagicPath’s new **Design Reference** feature allows you to anchor any element (button, navbar, etc.) and then reuse it via natural‑language prompts. To use it: (1) select a “master” element, (2) convert it to a Design Reference, (3) call it in a new prompt (e.g., “Create a hero section with this reference and add a gradient background”), (4) tweak the remix, and (5) export when finished[sergeichyrkov.com](https://sergeichyrkov.com/blog/magicpath-design-reference-the-smartest-way-to-reuse-ui-elements#:~:text=Step). Sergei Chyrkov explains that this workflow enforces consistency and speeds iteration[sergeichyrkov.com](https://sergeichyrkov.com/blog/magicpath-design-reference-the-smartest-way-to-reuse-ui-elements#:~:text=MagicPath%E2%80%99s%C2%A0Design%20Reference%C2%A0feature%20allows%20you%20to,maintaining%20your%20visual%20system%27s%20integrity). | Sergei Chyrkov’s tutorial[sergeichyrkov.com](https://sergeichyrkov.com/blog/magicpath-design-reference-the-smartest-way-to-reuse-ui-elements#:~:text=MagicPath%E2%80%99s%C2%A0Design%20Reference%C2%A0feature%20allows%20you%20to,maintaining%20your%20visual%20system%27s%20integrity)[sergeichyrkov.com](https://sergeichyrkov.com/blog/magicpath-design-reference-the-smartest-way-to-reuse-ui-elements#:~:text=Step) |
| **3 – Prompt with `getMediaObject` for webcam‑driven prototypes** | In his experimental “Magic Log,” Jacob Waites used the prompt “Can you use the luminance channel from my webcam feed?” and found that including the word `getMediaObject` reliably gives access to a webcam stream. He calls it a “pro tip” because it isn’t in the docs but enables interactive prototypes (e.g., distort a canvas based on webcam luminance)[imjacobwaites.medium.com](https://imjacobwaites.medium.com/magic-log-001-displacement-of-a-canvas-element-using-webcam-luminance-8df3946b41d3#:~:text=,grid%20of%20lines%20for%20testing). | Jacob Waites’ Magic Log[imjacobwaites.medium.com](https://imjacobwaites.medium.com/magic-log-001-displacement-of-a-canvas-element-using-webcam-luminance-8df3946b41d3#:~:text=,grid%20of%20lines%20for%20testing) |
| **4 – Start with components, then build pages** | A review on AI IXX notes that beginners should **generate individual components first** and only then assemble them into pages. Mastering component creation makes it easier to control layout and ensures exported code remains modular. The article’s “Pro tip” explicitly states: “Start with components, then build pages. Master the basics before attempting complex layouts”[aiixx.ai](https://www.aiixx.ai/blog/magicpathai-review-the-ai-website-builder-that-actually-understands-you-2025#:~:text=Getting%20Started%20with%C2%A0MagicPath). | AI IXX review[aiixx.ai](https://www.aiixx.ai/blog/magicpathai-review-the-ai-website-builder-that-actually-understands-you-2025#:~:text=Getting%20Started%20with%C2%A0MagicPath) |
| **5 – Leverage built‑in design systems** | MagicPath includes a **Design‑Systems Library** with pre‑made systems (OpenAI, Claude, Airbnb, etc.). Chyrkov notes that you can customize any aspect—colors, fonts, border radius—and save the system for later reuse[sergeichyrkov.com](https://sergeichyrkov.com/blog/full-guide-to-magicpath-ai#:~:text=Built%20In%20Design%20Systems). This library lets you generate on‑brand UIs without recreating tokens each time, and it’s hidden behind the “Design Systems” option in the sidebar. | Sergei Chyrkov’s guide[sergeichyrkov.com](https://sergeichyrkov.com/blog/full-guide-to-magicpath-ai#:~:text=Built%20In%20Design%20Systems) |
| **6 – Import Figma variables and CSS to keep your brand** | If you already have a design system in Figma, export its CSS variables and import them into MagicPath. Chyrkov highlights that MagicPath supports Figma variables, allowing you to preserve your brand’s typography, colors and spacing across AI‑generated screens[sergeichyrkov.com](https://sergeichyrkov.com/blog/full-guide-to-magicpath-ai#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20a%20design,Figma%20to%20design%20with%20AI). This keeps the exported code consistent with your existing design tokens. | Sergei Chyrkov’s guide[sergeichyrkov.com](https://sergeichyrkov.com/blog/full-guide-to-magicpath-ai#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20a%20design,Figma%20to%20design%20with%20AI) |
| **7 – Use reference images in prompts to anchor style** | The Banani review explains that MagicPath’s text‑to‑UI tool accepts a **reference image**; attaching a screenshot (e.g., an existing website) will guide the AI to match its layout and aesthetics[banani.co](https://www.banani.co/blog/magicpath-ai-review#:~:text=Code%20Export)[banani.co](https://www.banani.co/blog/magicpath-ai-review#:~:text=,designing%20multiple%20screens). Designers use this hack to clone colour schemes or composition from sites they like; it’s not obvious in the app but appears in the prompt area when you click the image icon. | Banani review[banani.co](https://www.banani.co/blog/magicpath-ai-review#:~:text=Code%20Export)[banani.co](https://www.banani.co/blog/magicpath-ai-review#:~:text=,designing%20multiple%20screens) |
| **8 – Generate variants to iterate rapidly** | Besides generating a UI from scratch, MagicPath can produce **variants** of any screen. Banani’s testers mention that you can select a screen and ask for variations; MagicPath returns multiple design options at once[banani.co](https://www.banani.co/blog/magicpath-ai-review#:~:text=Another%20cool%20feature%20is%20the,few%20variations%20of%20the%20screen). Power‑users use this to explore color schemes or layouts quickly instead of rewriting prompts. | Banani review[banani.co](https://www.banani.co/blog/magicpath-ai-review#:~:text=Another%20cool%20feature%20is%20the,few%20variations%20of%20the%20screen) |
| **9 – Share public links for feedback and SEO** | The AI Entrepreneurs’ guide suggests clicking “**Share**” inside MagicPath to create a public link. You can embed this link in blog posts or social media with keyword‑rich captions and invite comments[medium.com](https://medium.com/the-ai-entrepreneurs/build-launch-your-brand-with-magicpath-no-code-no-designer-55e03bc62b3c#:~:text=6.%20Share%20SEO,Feedback). This trick isn’t highlighted in the docs, but it lets teams, clients and investors review a project without logging in and also improves online visibility. | AI Entrepreneurs DIY guide[medium.com](https://medium.com/the-ai-entrepreneurs/build-launch-your-brand-with-magicpath-no-code-no-designer-55e03bc62b3c#:~:text=6.%20Share%20SEO,Feedback) |
| **10 – Build multi‑page flows and test interactions with Web Preview** | MagicPath’s infinite canvas allows you to design multi‑page flows. Chyrkov notes that he created a profile settings page by simply describing it, linked it back to his dashboard and simulated the navigation[sergeichyrkov.com](https://sergeichyrkov.com/blog/full-guide-to-magicpath-ai#:~:text=Creating%20Multi). The built‑in **Web Preview** renders your screens with hover effects and transitions so clients can interact with the prototype[sergeichyrkov.com](https://sergeichyrkov.com/blog/full-guide-to-magicpath-ai#:~:text=Web%20Previews%20in%20Real). For production hand‑off, Banani points out that the **Code Export** feature produces clean code suitable for developers[banani.co](https://www.banani.co/blog/magicpath-ai-review#:~:text=Code%20Export) and the Pro plan allows downloading the full codebase and opening it in Cursor[banani.co](https://www.banani.co/blog/magicpath-ai-review#:~:text=). | Sergei Chyrkov’s guide[sergeichyrkov.com](https://sergeichyrkov.com/blog/full-guide-to-magicpath-ai#:~:text=Creating%20Multi)[sergeichyrkov.com](https://sergeichyrkov.com/blog/full-guide-to-magicpath-ai#:~:text=Web%20Previews%20in%20Real); Banani review[banani.co](https://www.banani.co/blog/magicpath-ai-review#:~:text=Code%20Export)[banani.co](https://www.banani.co/blog/magicpath-ai-review#:~:text=) |

## **Observations and Additional Context**

* **Design Systems & Tokens** – MagicPath’s design system feature is still evolving. Users highlight the ability to import Figma variables and export CSS, which keeps AI‑generated components consistent with a brand’s look and speeds up developer hand‑off[sergeichyrkov.com](https://sergeichyrkov.com/blog/full-guide-to-magicpath-ai#:~:text=Built%20In%20Design%20Systems).

* **Code Quality** – While reviewers praise MagicPath for producing surprisingly clean React code, they caution that it isn’t perfect. Banani’s review notes that exported code “is clean enough to hand off to devs without shame”[banani.co](https://www.banani.co/blog/magicpath-ai-review#:~:text=Code%20Export) but may still require refactoring.

* **Workflow Efficiency** – Many users emphasise starting with smaller components, using the variant generator, and leveraging the infinite canvas for multi‑page flows to avoid prompt‑fatigue[aiixx.ai](https://www.aiixx.ai/blog/magicpathai-review-the-ai-website-builder-that-actually-understands-you-2025#:~:text=Getting%20Started%20with%C2%A0MagicPath)[banani.co](https://www.banani.co/blog/magicpath-ai-review#:~:text=Another%20cool%20feature%20is%20the,few%20variations%20of%20the%20screen). These workflow hacks help manage generation credits and reduce re‑prompts.

* **Hidden Commands** – Commands like `@component_name` and `getMediaObject` are not documented in the official help center yet, yet they unlock powerful functionality[medium.com](https://medium.com/@birdzhanhasan_26235/magicpath-ai-183688ec4c9d#:~:text=Eventually%2C%20I%20learned%20that%20you,easily%20import%20my%20previous%20work)[imjacobwaites.medium.com](https://imjacobwaites.medium.com/magic-log-001-displacement-of-a-canvas-element-using-webcam-luminance-8df3946b41d3#:~:text=,grid%20of%20lines%20for%20testing). Watching developer logs and community tutorials is currently the only way to discover them.

These community‑sourced tips and tricks can dramatically improve your productivity in MagicPath, streamline collaboration and ensure clean code handoff. By combining hidden prompt commands with smart workflow practices like Design Reference and variant generation, designers can build complex UIs more efficiently than relying on prompts alone.

These findings reveal numerous hidden commands and workflow hacks—such as referencing components with `@component_name`, using the Design Reference feature, and importing Figma tokens—that let you iterate faster and hand off cleaner code.

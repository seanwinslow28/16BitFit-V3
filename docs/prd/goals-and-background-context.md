# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

* Achieve **8,000 downloads** within the first month post-launch.  
* Establish an initial daily revenue stream of **$30/day** within the first month post-launch.  
* Validate the **SBFG category concept** by achieving a **Day-30 retention rate of 25%**.  
* Secure an average **4.5+ star rating** on app stores within 3 months post-launch.  
* Successfully demonstrate the core SBFG loop: Fitness Activity -> Data Sync -> Avatar Evolution + Stat Increase -> Skill-Based Combat -> Feedback.  
* Meet technical performance targets: **60fps combat** (90% consistency), **<50ms input latency**, **<150MB peak memory**.

## Background Context

16BitFit-V3 pioneers the **SBFG (Strength-Based Fighting Game)** category, addressing a gap where existing fitness apps lack deep, skill-based engagement and mobile fighting games lack real-world health integration. It targets the "Skill-Focused Fitness Gamer" by transforming validated fitness data (steps, workouts via HealthKit/Health Connect) into core power mechanics for an authentic, retro (Street Fighter 2 inspired) mobile fighting game. The core problem is the high churn in fitness apps (>70% in 3 months) due to superficial gamification and the sedentary nature of engaging mobile games.

16BitFit-V3 proposes a unique solution: a hybrid React Native (shell) + Phaser 3 (WebView combat engine) architecture using the high-performance "Hybrid Velocity Bridge". Key differentiators include the dual progression system (fitness-driven visual avatar evolution + skill-based combat rank), authentic 60fps fighting mechanics powered by real fitness, AI-driven personalization (avatar face integration), and a distinct retro aesthetic. The MVP focuses on establishing this core loop with 2 playable characters vs. 1 AI boss, basic fitness sync, and avatar evolution (Stages 1-2).

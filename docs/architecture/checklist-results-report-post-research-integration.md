# **Checklist Results Report (Post-Research Integration)**

*(Summary copied from previous response)*

## **1\. Executive Summary**

* **Project Type:** Fullstack (React Native Shell \+ Phaser WebView \+ Supabase BaaS)  
* **Overall Architecture Readiness:** High (Ready for Development)  
* **Critical Risks Identified:** Performance NFRs (Bridge), AI Dependency (Complexity/Cost), Bridge Complexity, Realtime Scalability, Skia Implementation.  
* **Key Strengths:** Leverages V2 wins, Clear SoC, Research-validated Tech Stack, Refined Backend Strategy (Hybrid Logic, Broadcast), Enhanced Security (RN Secure Proxy), Comprehensive Strategies (Testing, Error Handling etc.), Monorepo Structure.  
* **Sections Evaluated:** All sections evaluated.

## **2\. Section Analysis**

*(All sections ✅ PASS with high confidence after research integration. Minor points noted)*

## **3\. Risk Assessment (Updated based on Research)**

1. Hybrid Bridge Performance/Implementation (High) \- Mitigate: Early validation, Quality Tiers.  
2. AI Avatar Pipeline Complexity/Cost (Medium-High) \- Mitigate: Edge Function, Monitor, Fallback.  
3. Realtime Scalability (Medium) \- Mitigate: Private Channels, Minimal Payload, Fetch-on-Reconnect.  
4. Skia/Shader Implementation (Medium) \- Mitigate: Leverage examples, Allocate time.  
5. Phaser/WebView Limitations (Low-Medium) \- Mitigate: V2 Learnings, Memory Mgmt, Profiling.

## **4\. Recommendations**

* **Must-Fix:** None.  
* **Address Early:** Bridge Implementation, AI Avatar Pipeline, Skia Shader, PG Function workflow.  
* **Nice-to-Have:** Supabase generated types, Legend-State exploration.

## **5\. AI Implementation Readiness**

* **High Readiness.** Structure & patterns support AI dev. Careful prompting needed for Bridge, Skia, PG Functions.

## **6\. Frontend-Specific Assessment**

* Comprehensive, aligned with UI Spec, validated choices (Skia/Reanimated).

## ⏱️ EXPECTED TIMELINE

```
Deep Think Analysis:       10 minutes
Review Results:           15 minutes
Update Codex Guide:       15 minutes
Codex Implementation:     30 minutes
Testing & Validation:     45 minutes
                          ──────────
Total Time to Fix:        ~2 hours
```

## 🔍 ISSUES BEING VALIDATED

### Primary Issue (95% Confident)
**C++ Standard Mismatch** - Podfile forces C++17, but RN 0.76.9 needs C++20

### Secondary Issues (Need Validation)
- expo-modules-core version conflict (root vs workspace)
- Manual Metro config may conflict with SDK 52
- Missing React Native CLI dependencies
- Custom Metro script may be redundant

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION

Run this to verify all files are present:
```bash
cd "docs/COPIED FILES FOR DEEP THINK/"
ls -1 | grep -E "^[0-9]{2}_" | wc -l
```

Expected output: **13** (means all analysis files are present)

## 🎓 WHAT YOU'RE ASKING DEEP THINK TO DO

Deep Think will use extended reasoning to:
- Validate the C++20 migration strategy
- Assess monorepo configuration soundness
- Identify any hidden time bombs
- Risk-rate each proposed fix
- Provide a bulletproof remediation plan
- Create emergency recovery procedures

**This is different from a regular AI chat.** Deep Think will spend several minutes exploring solution paths, considering edge cases, and validating assumptions before providing recommendations.

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### Before Deep Think Analysis:
- ⏸️ **Don't make ANY changes yet** - wait for validation
- 💾 **Have backups ready** (Git checkpoint recommended)
- 📋 **Read the Quick Reference** to understand what you're asking for
- ⏰ **Allow 10-15 minutes** for complete analysis

### After Deep Think Analysis:
- 📄 **Copy the full response** somewhere safe
- ✅ **Mark approved fixes** in the Codex guide
- ❌ **Mark rejected fixes** clearly
- 🔍 **Note any new issues** discovered
- 📊 **Check confidence levels** (90%+ = proceed, <60% = reconsider)

### During Implementation:
- 🎯 **One fix at a time** - don't batch changes
- 🧪 **Test after each fix** - don't assume success
- 📝 **Log everything** - you'll need this if something fails
- 🔄 **Have rollback ready** - always know how to undo

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Read Deep Think's reasoning** - It's not just the answer, it's WHY
2. **Trust high confidence** - If Deep Think says 95%, it's very likely correct
3. **Test moderate confidence** - 60-80% means test carefully before full commit
4. **Question low confidence** - <60% warrants a second opinion
5. **Ask follow-ups** - If unclear, ask Deep Think to clarify specific points

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS INDICATORS

You'll know Deep Think analysis was successful if you receive:

- ✅ Clear approve/reject/caution on the C++20 fix
- ✅ Confidence percentages for each recommendation
- ✅ Numbered remediation steps with risk ratings
- ✅ Specific rollback procedures
- ✅ Testing checkpoints between phases
- ✅ Identification of any hidden issues
- ✅ Future prevention strategies

If any of these are missing or unclear, ask Deep Think for clarification.
